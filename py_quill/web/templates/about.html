    <p class="text-body">Hi there! We're the Snickerdoodle family: a dad, a mom, and a 7-year-old daughter who takes
      comedy very seriously.</p>
    <p class="text-body">This whole project started as a way to make our daughter laugh and giggle. We realized that
      pairing silly jokes with cute, whimsical artwork created a magic little moment of joy. It was too fun not to
      share, so we built the Snickerdoodle Jokes app to bring that daily laugh to other families.</p>
    <p class="text-body">But then we wanted to take the giggles beyond the screen. That led to our book, and now, our
      free lunchbox notes, giving parents a way to share a smile completely screen-free.</p>
